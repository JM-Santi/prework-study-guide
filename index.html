        <ul>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements that perform distinct roles.Though some HTML elements are visible to users, others provide important information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>The body element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the body element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>“Git checkout -b feature/name”: command to create a new feature branch.The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>“Git status”: command to see if you are working on the right branch.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>“Git add -A”: command to add the starter code to the current working branch.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>“Git pull origin main”: The pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>“Git push origin feature/name”: command to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
