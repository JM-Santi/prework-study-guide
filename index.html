        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements that perform distinct roles.Though some HTML elements are visible to users, others provide important information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the body element.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>The declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>Did you notice that the margin and padding properties are part of the declaration block for the * selector? Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>Link element creates the connection to the external file. The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource. The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
          <li>“Git checkout -b feature/name”: command to create a new feature branch.The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <li>It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
          <li>“Git status”: command to see if you are working on the right branch.</li>
          <li>“Git add -A”: command to add the starter code to the current working branch.</li>
          <li>“Git pull origin main”: The pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.</li>
          <li>“Git push origin feature/name”: command to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>Notice that the string is contained within quotation marks, ". All strings are surrounded by quotation marks. Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>To open the Chrome DevTools web console: Right click/Inspect.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>If we wanted to access only the triangle, we start with the name of the variable that stores the array. Then we add the index to the end of the array name in square brackets.</li>
          <li>Manually changing the values of the index is still not the most efficient way to log the values in the array.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>A for loop starts with—you guessed it—for.</li>
          <li>For now, let's "comment out" the conditional statement that we worked with in the last step. Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword, similar to how we used the var keyword to declare a new variable. Then we give our function a unique name. We will use this unique name whenever we call the function. In order for the code inside a function to run, we need to call the function. To do so, type the name of the function in the console.</li>
