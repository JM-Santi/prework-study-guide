        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements that perform distinct roles.Though some HTML elements are visible to users, others provide important information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the body element.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>The declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>Did you notice that the margin and padding properties are part of the declaration block for the * selector? Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>Link element creates the connection to the external file. The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource. The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
          <li>“Git checkout -b feature/name”: command to create a new feature branch.The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <li>It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
          <li>“Git status”: command to see if you are working on the right branch.</li>
          <li>“Git add -A”: command to add the starter code to the current working branch.</li>
          <li>“Git pull origin main”: The pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.</li>
          <li>“Git push origin feature/name”: command to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
